## Troubleshooting

### No Results Appearing
- Verify your Jira URL is correct and accessible
- Check that your API token is valid and hasn't expired
- Ensure you have permission to view the projects you're searching

### Timeout Issues
- Increase the timeout setting in plugin configuration
- Check your internet connection to the Jira instance
- Verify the Jira instance is responsive

### Authentication Errors
- Regenerate your API token in Atlassian Account Settings
- Ensure you're using your email address as the username (for Atlassian Cloud)
- Check that your account has appropriate permissions

### User Search Not Working
- Make sure usernames are spelled correctly
- User search is case-sensitive
- Some users might not be searchable depending on Jira permissions
